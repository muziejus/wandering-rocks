## Fabula and Sjužet

<p class="lead">“Fabula” and “sjužet” are two words that have entered into
narrative theory via Russian Formalism. Both “фабула” and “сюжет” can mean
“plot,” but early 20th century Russian critics narrowed down their definitions.
Fabula, in its most basic sense, is the historical order of the events in a
story. Sjužet (from the French word for plot, “sujet,”) is the narrative order
of the story.</p>

For example, in _Ulysses_, episode 3 (“Proteus”) is _after_ episode 4
(“Calypso”) in the novel’s fabula, as the events in the former take place
starting at 11:00 on Bloomsday, while the events in the latter cover
8:00–10:00. However, “Proteus” is _before_ “Calypso” in the sjužet, as it is
the third episode, and “Calypso” is the fourth. Reading _Ulysses_’s fabula
would force reading episode 4 before episode 3. Reading its sjužet reverses the
process.

These contrasting and perhaps contradictory temporalities (or, better,
spatiotemporalities) separate the novel from the world that he novel creates.
Woloch notes, when discussing story/discourse, histoire/discours, and
fabula/sjužet, that

>All these dichotomous terms refer, finally, to the essentially divided nature
>of the literary text, as it is torn between form and content; between the
>signified and the signifier; between the text’s linguistic world—words,
>sentences, chapters—and the imagined world that we grasp at through the text.
>Discourse [sjužet] points us to the narrative’s actual language and structure;
>story [fabula] to the fictional events that we reconstruct through the
>narrative (38).

The world generated by the novel has a spacetime that interacts with the
aesthetic means by which the world is uncovered in the plot. The elements of
the fabula are abstracted out and exist in a spatiotemporality we could call
“geohistory,” one where time moves only in one direction. Hence the fabula of
the Dublin created in “Wandering Rocks” could actually begin with the 8th Earl
of Kildare, whose late 15th century rule of Ireland comes up in conversation
between Lambert and O’Molloy, as those acts are a cause whose effect (the
conversation), bubbles up on Bloomsday. For the purposes of this visualization,
however, the timeline of the fabula marches in its solitary direction from 14:55
to 15:58 on 16 June 1904.

The elements of the fabula, however, provide the foundation for the sjužet.
Here, the building blocks of the novel world’s geohistory are recombined with
aesthetics in mind. Within the sjužet, the fabula is reordered, and the
timeline is no longer a persistent march forward. 

Though _Ulysses_ moves linearly for the most part (save the clock’s resetting
at the beginning of “Calypso” as noted above), in “Wandering Rocks,” it’s clear
how different fabula and sjužet can be. Because of Joyce’s meticulous design
for the chapter, we can see it as a network of crisscrossing timelines. The
first moment in the episode is the same in both fabula and sjužet; Conmee
checks his watch. Similarly, the last is the same in both as well; Artifoni
finally catches a Dalkey tram just as the viceregal cavalcade passes him by.
But these events bookend something that jumps back and forth, underscoring the
different modes of spatiotemporality offered by fabula and sjužet. Yet because
of the necessary temporal component of spatiotemporality, it doesn’t suffice to
think of “Wandering Rocks” with a fixed map showing everyone’s journeys. The
animation—two of them, in fact—is the only way to remain true to the
simultaneity of the episode.

Furthermore, “Wandering Rocks”’s focus on minor characters also highlights the
tension between the world of the novel (where the fabula is) and its art (where
the sjužet is). The episode takes the reader out of the frame of the Odyssey,
of the story of Stephen and Bloom. Instead, it showcases Dublin and its
inhabitants, a side story populated by masses of minor characters not typically
given the space to breathe in a novel.
