# Wandering Rocks

<p class="lead">“Wandering Rocks” is the most obviously complexly, mechanically
intertwined episode in James Joyce’s 1992 novel <em>Ulysses</em>. It also stands
outside of the rest of the novel in its use of spatiotemporality, focus on
secondary characters, and lack of an analogue in <em>The Odyssey</em>.</p>

_Ulysses_, after all, has structural similarities to *The Odyssey*, but in the
latter, Odysseus is only told about the danger of sailing through the Wandering
Rocks. He takes his chances, instead, with Scylla and Charybdis. As a result,
the episode provides Joyce a bit of space in which to play outside the frame of
the rest of the novel, which is, of course, already a very forgiving frame.

Ellmann notes that the episode brings “the city of Dublin even more fully into
the book by focusing upon it rather than upon Bloom or Stephen,” the two main
characters of the novel (452). In its difference from the rest of the novel on
these terms, it also reflects back on the rest of the novel. Gilbert adds,
“In its structure and its _technic_ (“labyrinth”) this episode may be regarded
as a small-scale model of _Ulysses_ as a whole” (227).

As a novel-within-a-novel, then, the episode is broken up into 19 distinct
sections. Each centers around, more or less, a different character. Some move
around, with the greatest distance covered in the first and last sections. But
other characters remain in one place during the course of their section.
Furthermore, each section except the last features at least one “intrusion,”
which acts like a jump cut taking us to another location but at the same time.
Because the intrusions typically refer to characters who show up elsewhere in
the episode, it becomes possible to plot out a timeline of events, which is
what this visualization does.  We know person *x* was at place _n_ to meet
person *y*, but over at _m_ later to meet person *z*. But through the
intrusions, we also know where *x* and *z* were at the same time, though
separate from one another. These collisions are nowhere clearer than in the
final section, which features a viceregal cavalcade riding from Phoenix Park to
the Mirus Bazaar in Ballsbridge, thereby riding straight through downtown
Dublin, where nearly every character in the episode has an opportunity to
remark on the cavalcade as it rides past.

A brief description of each of the 19 episodes:

1. Father Conmee walks from his church to Artane, taking the tram for a part of his trip.

2. Corny Kelleher tends to a coffin and speaks to a constable.
